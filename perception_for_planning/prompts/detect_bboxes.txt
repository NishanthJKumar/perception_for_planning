Task instruction: "{task_instruction}"

Return bounding boxes as a JSON array with labels. Never return masks
or code fencing. Limit to 25 objects. Include as many objects as you
can identify in the image that are relevant to the task. 
DO NOT include the robot or robot gripper. DO NOT include objects or 
surfaces irrelevant to the task or too far away to matter 
(e.g. walls, things on the floor below the table, people who might be 
in the scene, etc.)


If an object is present multiple times, name them according to their
unique characteristic (colors, size, position, unique characteristics, etc.).

The format should be as follows: [{"box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax],
"label": <label for the object>}] normalized to 0-1000. The values in
box_2d must only be integers.
