You are viewing an image with labeled objects and need to translate a natural language task into formal predicates.

TASK: {task_instruction}

AVAILABLE OBJECTS (with their labels visible in the image):
{object_list}

AVAILABLE PREDICATES:
- on(movable, surface): Object A is placed on top of object B

Please analyze the task and return a JSON list of predicates that represent the goal state.
Each predicate should specify:
- "name": the predicate name (e.g., "on")
- "args": list of object labels that should be arguments (e.g., ["red_cup", "table"])

For example, if the task is "put the red cup on the table", you might return:
[{"name": "on", "args": ["red cup", "table"]}]

Look carefully at the labeled image to identify the specific objects mentioned in the task.
Only use object labels that are visible in the image.

Return your response as a JSON array (no code fencing):
