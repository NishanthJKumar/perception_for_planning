In general, follow the following instructions when writing and editing code:
1. Type hints: always type hint function inputs. Assume we use python 3.10+, so do not do things like `from typing import List`, just use `list`
2. Short docstrings for functions - if at all: you don't need to write docstrings for functions unless you think they're informative.
3. Don't use try/except blocks unless explicitly told.
